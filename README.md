## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

    To get started with the chess engine, you first need to clone the repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danialasaria/chessEngine.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change your current working directory to the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd chessEngine
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command reads the `package.json` file in the project directory and installs all the necessary dependencies listed there.

## Running the Project
After setting up the project, you can run the HTML file in your browser. There are two main ways to do this:

1. **Using a Local Development Server**

    If you prefer to run a local development server, you can use the `serve` method provided you have it installed. If not, you can install it globally on your machine via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```

    Then, start the server with:

    ```bash
    serve
    ```

    By default, `serve` will host your project on a local web server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your web browser and go to this URL to view your project.

2. **Directly in Your Browser**

- Navigate to the project folder in your file explorer or finder.
- Locate the HTML file you want to view and double-click on it to open it in your default web browser.
